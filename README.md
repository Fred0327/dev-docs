ZKEX is a decentralized L2 multi-chain order book exchange (DEX), build on three ZK-rollups: `zkLink`, `Starkware`, and `zkSync`.

Users will be able to trade assets from multiple chains with a similar experience as on Binance or Coinbase, but instead, ZKEX will be decentralized, trust minimized, and non-custodial, with transactions secured with zero-knowledge proofs.
